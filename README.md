# Hand-Detector

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of counting fingers and distinguishing between left and right hands.

## About

The Hand-Detector project leverages deep learning techniques to create a robust model that can accurately count the number of fingers shown in an image and identify whether the hand is left or right. This can be particularly useful in various applications such as gesture recognition, human-computer interaction, and sign language interpretation.

## Features

- **Finger Counting**: Accurately counts the number of fingers shown in an image.
- **Hand Identification**: Distinguishes between left and right hands.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes a CNN for high accuracy and performance.

## Installation

To get started with the Hand-Detector project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shaoting-Feng/Hand-Detector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Hand-Detector
   ```

## Usage

To use the Hand-Detector, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
2. Train the model using the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts.
3. Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.
